// Package service provides a high level API for registering custom plugin
// components and executing either a standard Benthos CLI, or programmatically
// building isolated pipelines with a StreamBuilder API.
//
// For a video guide on Benthos plugins check out: https://youtu.be/uH6mKw-Ly0g
// And an example repo containing component plugins and tests can be found at:
// https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos-plugin-example
//
// In order to add custom Bloblang functions and methods use the
// ./public/bloblang package.

	// Write methods are called and the connection that they maintain is lost.
	// This error prompts the upstream component to call Connect until the
	// connection is re-established.

	// data to the point where subsequent Read calls will be ineffective. This
	// error prompts the upstream component to gracefully terminate the
	// pipeline.
	ErrEndOfInput = errors.New("end of input")

	// ErrEndOfBuffer is returned by a buffer Read/ReadBatch method when the
	// contents of the buffer has been emptied and the source of the data is

	// component to gracefully terminate the pipeline.

	// cleaned up or the context is cancelled. Returns an error if the context
